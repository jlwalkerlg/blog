Can there be moral truths without god? Can right and wrong be objective facts, or are they merely opinions? If there is no god, do we still have moral obligations?

The typical religious view is that good and bad are *defined* by god. Therefore, objective moral truths *do* exist, and it's "right" to do that which god deems to be good. In fact, we are obligated by god to do so. If you remove god from the equation, you also remove the objective basis for moral truths and therefore reduce them to mere differences in opinions with no real way to determine right and wrong. You also remove any moral obligations because without moral truths there's no "right" way that anyone could be obligated to act.

It's true that there are no objective moral obligations as such, in that universe itself is indifferent to what we do as humans. However, there are consequences for our actions that are imposed by society. Why shouldn't we do that which is bad, like murdering someone? Because we don't want to suffer the consequences of spending the rest of our lives in prison. In general, we want to act in a way that creates the world that we want to live in. We want to be treated fairly, so we should be fair to others. We don't want to be treated unfairly, so we shouldn't be unfair to others. If everyone in society cooperates with these principles, then we all work together towards a better world for all of us. In this sense, *we* can define what is "right" and "wrong" as a society.

Theists might see this as a fragile basis for moral obligations, but it actually seems to be the same basis that they use. Even if there is a god, why shouldn't I act against him and do that which is bad? Because in doing so I'd suffer the consequences — the torments of hell, or some other such punishment depending on the religion. Why should I strive to be a good moral character? Because in doing so I'd reap the benefits — admittance into heaven, etc. One important difference would be that in the religious view god is always watching, so he'd see everything that you do even when no one else is looking, whereas without god you may be able to get away with certain wrongdoings. So it is.

So without god, how do we define good and bad? Well, since our so-called moral obligations seem to stem from concern for our own well-being, we can define good as that which increases our well-being and bad as that which decreases it. But what if 2 people have contradictory well-beings such that what is good for the one is bad for the other, and vice versa? Is it possible that what is good for one person may be bad for another? How do we resolve these conflicts?
