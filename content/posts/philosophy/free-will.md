The idea of free will is something that we all take for granted. We carry around with us at all times a sense of personal agency where we feel as though we have the power to make deliberate choices. Each decision is well and truly our own, we feel, and if we could go back in time to the moment we made a particular decision, we imagine that we could have chosen otherwise.

Most of us never scrutinise this idea of free will, because our sense of personal agency is so strong and instinctive that it never even occurs to us to do so. However, when we try to find a place for it in science, it comes up against determinism and we find that it contradicts the principles of cause and effect.

Determinism is the idea that all effects have a cause. For example, the snooker ball moved because it was struck by the cue ball, which itself moved because it was struck by the cue. This causal chain extends infinitely into both the past and the future, and serves as the basis for our ability not only to do science, but to reason at all. If effects were _not_ caused by prior events, then there'd be no basis on which we could make any reasoned predictions about the future given what is happening now, or any reasoned explanations of the past given what happened before.

But if every effect is part of this causal chain, then our thoughts and actions must be too (unless we are to believe that they're not subject to the usual laws of the universe). This is where our idea of free will starts to unfold.

The proximate cause of any voluntary action is our intention to perform it. But each intention and thought is itself preceded by a myriad of its own explanatory causes. Here the infinite regress begins, and continues indefinitely without interruption by any conscious agent.
