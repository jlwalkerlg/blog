The difference between coupling and cohesion is whether or not you expect changes to one piece of code to affect another piece of code.

With coupling, you do not expect (or want) changes to one piece of code to affect another. If it does, then those pieces of code are coupled.

With cohesion, you expect that changes to one piece of code will affect another, and therefore expect to have to update it together. This code is cohesive, and you usually keep it close together.
